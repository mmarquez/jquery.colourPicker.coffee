Use this plug-in on a normal <select>-element filled with colours to turn it in to a colour-picker widget that allows users to view all the colours in the drop-down as well as enter their own, preferred, custom colour. Only about 1k compressed.

HOW TO USE
jQuery('select[name="colour"]').colourPicker({ico: 'my-icon.gif', title: 'Select a colour from the list'}); Would replace the select with 'my-icon.gif' which, when clicked, would open a dialogue with the title 'Select a colour from the list'.

You can close the colour-picker without selecting a colour by clicking anywhere outside the colour-picker box.
